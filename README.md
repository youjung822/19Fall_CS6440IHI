# FoodPlanner
FoodPlanner

A tool to help guide people in the direction of meal planning based on current conditions. Patients should be able to upload their conditions and allergies from some sources or manually. Users should also be able to scan or manually enter in ingredients available. The app should help to provide quick, intermediate, or other meal ideas based on these factors. Users are able to create a new account/login with an existing account. A test user has been mapped to an FHIR patient to demonstrate the ability to automatically pull allergies into the userâ€™s session. Recipe results can link users to full recipes as well as display some basic nutritional information.
