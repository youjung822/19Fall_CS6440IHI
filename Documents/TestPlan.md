# Test Plan (Version 1.0)

This test plan is designed to describe the testing strategy, test selection techniques, adequacy criteria, bug tracking and also includes the test cases to be executed to validate the Food Planner Web App.

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall Strategy

In order to have a robust application, a team should prepare a progressive testing plan which should include unit tests, integration tests and system (also called End to End) tests. Apart from that, to ensure that the application does not collapse due to unforeseen non functional requirements or enhanced functionality, a good regression test suite must also be executed quite often (or after every build).

Following levels of testing will be performed:

**Unit Testing** : Every developer will test their respective modules.

**System Test** : We will have Integration and complete E2E validations being done during this phase. We will start by looking at some integrated systems and then finally test the whole system. If needed, we will plan to run some End to End scenarios on Hangouts calls in order to ensure no bugs seep through after deployment. 

### 1.2 Test Selection

Testing will mostly be based on black box techniques. White box testing would only be done if any code reviews are required in case of an elusive/critical issue encountered during integration/system testing.

Black box techniques that would be heavily used in different stages of testing are Class Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis. Both these techniques when used in conjunction will help eliminate most of the bugs in the app.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

We will stick to the basics of branch coverage and statement coverage techniques to ensure that we have a quality test suite.  

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

For bug tracking our team would be using **Github Repo - Issues Section**.  

### 1.5 Test Case Execution

We will be executing the test cases manually. Our intent was to focus more on finding a better and faster way of developing the App and testing it thoroughly. 

## 2 Test Cases
*We are still finalizing the design and the requirements. Once everything is completed, we will have the test cases written as per the system expectations.
